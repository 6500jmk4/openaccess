The Metropolitan Museum of Art Open Access
===================

The Met presents over 5,000 years of art from around the world for everyone to experience and enjoy. The Museum lives in three iconic sites in New York City—The Met Fifth Avenue, The Met Breuer, and The Met Cloisters. Millions of people also take part in The Met experience online.

Since it was founded in 1870, The Met has always aspired to be more than a treasury of rare and beautiful objects. Every day, art comes alive in the Museum's galleries and through its exhibitions and events, revealing both new ideas and unexpected connections across time and across cultures.

We will be updating this section with more information about our Open Access initiative soon.

## Additional usage guidelines
### Images not included
Images are not included and are not part of the dataset. To license images of works of art in the Met's collection, please visit our [Image Resources](http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/image-resources) page. 

### Research in progress
This data is provided “as is” for research purposes and you use this data at your own risk. Much of the information included in this dataset is not complete and has not been curatorially approved. The Met  offers the datasets as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind.

We plan to update the datasets with new and revised information on a regular basis. You are advised to regularly update your copy of the datasets to ensure you are using the best available information.

### Pull requests
Because these datasets are generated from our internal database, we do *not* accept pull requests. If you have identified errors or have extra information to share, please email us at [open-access@metmuseum.org](mailto:open-access@metmuseum.org) and we will forward to the appropriate department for review.

### Give attribution to the Met
The Met requests that you actively acknowledge and give attribution to the Met wherever possible. If you use one or both of the datasets for a publication, please cite it using our digital object identifier. Attribution supports efforts to release other data. It also reduces the amount of “orphaned data,” helping retain links to authoritative sources.

### Do not misrepresent the dataset
Do not mislead others or misrepresent the datasets or their source. You must not use the Met’s trademarks or otherwise claim or imply that the Met endorses you or your use of the dataset.

Whenever you transform, translate or otherwise modify the dataset, you must make it clear that the resulting information has been modified. If you enrich or otherwise modify the dataset, consider publishing the derived dataset without reuse restrictions.
